# Think Reason Learn   
[Website](https://thinkreasonlearn.com/) · [Docs](https://thinkreasonlearn.com/modules.html)  

TRL is an open-source Python library that extends traditional machine learning with language-based reasoning.
It re-implements core algorithms such as decision trees and random forests so that each step of the model can call on an LLM as a reasoning function instead of a static heuristic.

The goal is to keep the structure and interpretability of classical ML while giving models the context understanding and generalization of LLMs.
You can think of it as scikit-learn with reasoning built in.

TRL is developed by Vela Research in collaboration with the University of Oxford. Our first applications are in venture capital, where explainable, high-stakes predictions matter but the framework is domain-agnostic. It can be used for any decision-making system, including law, healthcare, finance, and customer support.

## Key Features

- **Explainable AI**: Every prediction comes with traceable reasoning paths, rules, or cluster descriptions.
- **Fully Async Design**: Scalable LLM interactions built for concurrent processing.
- **Modular Algorithms**: Easily extend with new models under a unified interface.

## Core Algorithms

- **GPTree**: LLM-guided decision trees for dynamic feature generation.
- **RRF (Random Rule Forest)**: Transparent ensembles of LLM-generated YES/NO rules.
- **Policy Induction**: Ensembles of LLM-generated decision policies with learned weights.
- **Reasoned Rule Mining (RRM)**: Mines natural-language IF-THEN rules from LLM reasoning into a calibrated, weighted ensemble.
- **Verifiable RL**: Adaptive information-gathering — a learned policy decides what to reveal next (or stop), then classifies from the partial state.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- pip (latest version recommended)
- Graphviz system package installed (e.g., `brew install graphviz`, `apt-get install graphviz`)

### Standard Installation

```bash
pip install think-reason-learn
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vela-research/think-reason-learn.git
cd think-reason-learn
poetry install
```

### Development Setup

For contributing or running tests/docs:

```bash
poetry install --with dev,docs
poetry run pre-commit install  # Optional: code quality hooks
```

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter dependency issues, ensure your Python version matches.
- For LLM integrations, set API keys as environment variables (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY).
- See [Contributing](https://github.com/Vela-Research/think-reason-learn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more dev tips.

## Quick Start

### GPTree

```python
import asyncio
from IPython.display import display, Image
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from think_reason_learn.gptree import GPTree
from think_reason_learn.core.llms import GoogleChoice, OpenAIChoice, XAIChoice, AnthropicChoice

X = pd.DataFrame({
    "founder_info": [
        "Alex is a serial entrepreneur with two successful exits, strong network in Silicon Valley, and expertise in AI.",
        "Jordan graduated top of class from MIT but has no prior business experience and limited funding.",
        "Taylor has 10 years in finance, secured seed funding quickly, and built a talented team.",
        "Casey started a company right out of high school, faced multiple failures, but persists with innovative ideas.",
        "Morgan is a former Google engineer with patents in machine learning and venture capital backing.",
    ]
})

y = ["successful", "failed", "successful", "failed", "successful"]

async def main():
    tree = GPTree(
        qgen_llmc=[
            GoogleChoice(model="gemini-2.0-flash-lite"),
            OpenAIChoice(model="gpt-4.1-nano"),
            XAIChoice(model="grok-3-mini"),
        ],
        critic_llmc=[
            OpenAIChoice(model="gpt-4.1-nano"),
            AnthropicChoice(model="claude-3-5-haiku-latest"),
            XAIChoice(model="grok-3-mini"),
        ],
        qgen_instr_llmc=[
            GoogleChoice(model="gemini-2.0-flash-lite"),
            XAIChoice(model="grok-3-mini"),
        ],
    )

    qgit = await tree.set_task(
        task_description="Predict if a startup founder will be successful or fail based on their background.",
    )
    print(qgit)

    fitter = tree.fit(X, y, reset=True)
    async for node in fitter:
        root = node

    # Visualize (requires Graphviz system package installed)
    display(Image(tree.view_tree()))

    predictions = await tree.predict(X)
    for pred in predictions:
        print(pred)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Using a local model (Ollama, vLLM)

The `openai` provider works against any OpenAI-compatible server. Point it at
your local endpoint and pick your local model — no code changes needed:

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1   # Ollama's default port
export OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama                       # any non-empty value works locally
```

```python
from think_reason_learn.core.llms import OpenAIChoice

qgen_llmc = [OpenAIChoice(model="qwen3:8b")]  # any model served locally
```

When `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is set, TRL routes requests through
`/v1/chat/completions` with token logprobs (which Reasoned Rule Mining
depends on) instead of `/v1/responses`, which local servers don't implement.
Set `OPENAI_ENDPOINT_STYLE` to `responses` or `chat_completions` to override
the auto-detection.
